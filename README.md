A Python projet to play with the Sony Camera Remote API

This project provides a scriptable way to access over wifi various features of the Sony cameras that
implement the Camera Remote API (https://developer.sony.com/develop/cameras/).

The SDK provided by Sony is targetted for Android and iOS developers.
The objective of this project is to create a tool or a set of tools to control
Sony cameras from a Linux desktop and anything that can run Python.

## Features
The basic set of features that are going to be implemented include:
* Live view
* take pictures
* configure various parameters

## Dependencies
* Python 3.something
* python-opencv
* a compatible Sony camera connected over wifi in the "Smart Remote Control" app

## Wishes
* Same features as the Windows/Mac USB client Remote Camera Control
* LiveView
* Timelapse with controls
* Play with OpenCV to add more advanced features  (motion detector, intelligent exposure, bulb ramping, etc)

## Help needed
* All the features
* Packaging
* Mobile integration (?)
* UI/UX
* Feedback, testing, improvement suggestions
